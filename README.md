# To_Do_List skill test



## Problem statement

Create a simple Todo list with vanilla JS. Vanilla JS means no plugins, no libraries, nothing.
## Features

->A minimal design with HTML and CSS, it should look nice (no libraries, no frameworks).

->A text box at the top to add a todo item to the list.
Add button: when a user clicks on the button, add that todo item to the list.

->A delete button to delete the todo item completely from the list.

->A checkbox to check the item off the list. (checked item should stay in the list, with some differentiation from rest of the todo items)

->Total number of tasks in the list.

## Languages Used

HTML, CSS and Javascript
## What I learned

This project helped me to understand the practical use cases of JavaScript and build a strong foundation in JavaScript development. I also learned about the local storage API and how to use it to preserve ToDo list data even after closing the browser and retrieve them when the user reopens the app.
